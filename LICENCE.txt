     concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied,
     statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of
     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
     non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
     the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
     discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full
     or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.

  b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable
     to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation,
     negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect,
     incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses,

     Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory for Your acquisition of
     such Acquired Materials, Your being subject to licenses that may be
     applicable to any Acquired Materials, or Your failure to comply with
     licenses that may be applicable to any Acquired Materials.

  d. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability
     provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver
     of all liability.

Section 6  -  Term and Termination.

  a. This Coho License applies for as long as you possess the
     Licensed Material. However, if You fail to comply with this Coho
     License, then Your rights under this Coho License terminate

     persons to whom You have provided Licensed Material or Adapted
     Material, shall thereafter be in violation of this Coho License.

     under Section 6(a), it reinstates:

     1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
        it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
     2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not
     affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your
     violations of this Coho License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
       distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so

     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be
     made without permission under this Coho License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Coho License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Coho License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Coho License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Coho License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes
     of any jurisdiction or authority.
